    <GunPolicy name="1. End The Gun Show Loophole">
      <!-- https://giffords.org/lawcenter/gun-laws/policy-areas/gun-sales/gun-shows/ -->
      <p>
       The gun show loop hole refers to the fact that federal law does not require background checks
        on sales from unlicensed sellers including online or at gun shows making it easy for a prohibited person
        to acquire a gun. Though this federal law applies to many situations outside of gun shows, gun shows are of
        specific interest as they are popular places to purchase firearms and guns purchased at gun shows are
        disproportionately used in criminal activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ending the gun show loophole can be acheived by specific policy targeting gun show sales or by wider
        policies such as requiring universal background checks prior to all firearm transfers.

    </GunPolicy>

    <GunPolicy name="2. Universal Background Checks">
      <!-- https://giffords.org/lawcenter/gun-laws/policy-areas/background-checks/universal-background-checks/
      https://www.everytown.org/what-is-the-background-check-loophole/ -->
      <p>Federal law requires background checks on all gun sales from licensed firearm dealers to ensure that gun
          buyers do not fall into one of the categories of people prohibited by law from having a gun. But the law
          does not require background checks on sales from unlicensed sellers, including online or private sales
          making it easy for a prohibited person to acquire a gun.
      </p>

      <p>
        Implementing universal background checks would require the implementation of federal law which would require
        background checks for all firearm transactions.

    <GunPolicy name="3. Increase Mandatory Waiting Periods">
      <!-- https://www.aap.org/en/advocacy/state-advocacy/waiting-periods-for-firearms-purchases/ -->
      <p>
        Under current federal law, there is no waiting period (time between when you want the gun and when you get it)
         requirement for the purchase of guns. Introducing waiting period laws give law enforcement additional time to perform an accurate background
         check and create a “cooling off” period to prevent acts of violence or suicide attempts.
      </p>
    </GunPolicy>

    <GunPolicy name="4. Age Restrict High Capacity Firearms">
      <!-- https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/minimum-age.html -->
      <p>
        Under federal law, licensed dealers cannot sell or deliver handguns to individuals under age 21 or
         long guns to those under age 18. This is problematic as firearm homicides and violent crimes disproportionately
         involve individuals under age 21, both as perpetrators and as victims. Additionally there is a strong association
         between firearm availability and suicide. To reduce firearm violence for individuals under 21 law could be introduced
         to prevent sales of long guns or high calibre rifles to persons aged under 21, similar to that of hand guns.
      </p>
    </GunPolicy>

    <GunPolicy name="5. Mandatory Gun Insurance">
      <p>
        Mandatory gun insurance on a federal level would require gun owners to puchase insurance for the firearms
         they decide to buy. This would act in a similar way to Mandatory car insurance where rifle owners purchase
         coverage for events such as accidental shootings or self-defence. Though not directly limiting gun sales, higher
         cost of gun ownership would lower the amount of gun purchases while helping to negate the financial harm
         of gun violence raising revenue to fund programs to reduce gun violence.
      </p>
    </GunPolicy>

    <GunPolicy name="6. Mandatory Community Support Letters">
      <p>
        Requiring persons aged under 21 to receive letters from adults within the community stating they are comfortable
        with them owning firearms would help to decrease the liklihood an unstable or irresponsible individule owning firearms.
        Firearms have the potential to affect all individuals of a community and affect the overall sense of safety members of the
        community feel. Similar to how applying for a job requires references to ensure employees are appropriate so too
        should the responsibiloity of owning a firearm be appropriate at a young age.
      </p>
    </GunPolicy>

    <GunPolicy name="7. Extend The List of Banned Firearms">
      <p>
        Its not legal to own mortars, nuclear bombs, tanks or anti air missels. Some firearms serve only the
        purpose of acting as killing machines such as the AR-15. By adding these weapons to the list of
        banned firearms it limits the amount of violence people can commit against each other.
      </p>
    </GunPolicy>

    <GunPolicy name="8. Mental Health Evaluations">
      <p>
        Introducing mandatory mental health evaluations for all firearm purchases at a federal level
        would help to decrease the amount of mentally unstable people who own firearms. These health evaluations
        could also required at periodic intervals i.e. every 2 years similar to how doctors have to renew there medical licences.
        This would help to keep firearms out of the hands of mentally ill people and those who develop mental ilnesses at
        different points in there life.
      </p>
    </GunPolicy>

    <GunPolicy name="9. Extensive Licencing Process">
      <p>
        When your apply for a drivers licence you have to sit and pass both practical and theoretical
        tests before you can be a licence driver. This ensures a higher quality of drivers which reduces
        the dangers of driving. The same process can be applied to firearm ownership where owners have to sit
        and pass both practical and theoretical tests. This would help increase the amount responsible gun owners
        leading to less accidents and gun violence.
      </p>
    </GunPolicy>

    <GunPolicy name="10. Gun Buyback Program">
      <p>
        A gun buy back program is a government program which pays gun owners for their firearms without any risk of
        prosecution. Merely having an optional gun buy back program makes it easier for gun owners to hand over
        unwanted guns thereby decreasing total gun ownership and the risk of gun violence.
      </p>
