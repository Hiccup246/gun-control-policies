    <GunPolicy name="1. End The Gun Show Loophole">
      <p>
        Gun shows are events dedicated to the display and sale of firearms and firearm-related accessories.
         Often held at public venues like fairgrounds or civic centers, gun shows operate as temporary, largely
         unregulated markets for the transfer of firearms. Thousands of people attend the more than 4,000 gun
         shows held in the United States each year.1 Firearm purchases from gun shows account for 4% to 9% of
         annual firearm sales,2 and 3% of gun owners report acquiring their most recent firearm from a gun show.

    <GunPolicy name="2. Universal Background Checks">
      <!-- <p>Require essentailly every firearms transactionin the usa to be recorded and go through the national instant criimal background checks system. And that is somtimes called the private sale exemption.</p>
      <p>They are not required by USA federal law. 22 states and dc for at least some private sales.</p> -->

      <p>Federal law requires background checks on all gun sales from licensed firearm dealers to ensure that gun
          buyers do not fall into one of the categories of people prohibited by law from having a gun. But the law
          does not require background checks on sales from unlicensed sellers, including online or at gun shows—making
          it easy for a prohibited person to acquire a gun. Federal law also fails to prohibit certain categories of
          people with particularly dangerous histories, and it does not provide a process through which people who
          are likely to commit violent acts against themselves or others can be blocked from having access to guns.
      </p>

      <p>Any comprehensive gun violence prevention strategy must start with background checks on all gun sales and
          build upon them to close other existing loopholes that enable prohibited people to access guns, including
          the one that allows a gun sale to proceed if a background check isn’t completed within three business days
          and addressing the rising threat of ghost guns. For more information check out <a href="https://giffords.org/lawcenter/gun-laws/policy-areas/background-checks/universal-background-checks/">Giffords Law Center</a>
