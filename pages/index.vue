    <GunPolicy name="1. End The Gun Show Loophole">
      <!-- What is the problem -->
      <!-- What is a possible solution -->
      <p>
       The gun show loop hole refers to the fact that federal law does not require background checks
        on sales from unlicensed sellers including online or at gun shows making it easy for a prohibited person
        to acquire a gun. Though this federal law applies to many situations outside of gun shows, gun shows are of
        specific interest as they are popular places to purchase firearms and guns purchased at gun shows are
        disproportionately used in criminal activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ending the gun show loophole can be acheived by specific policy targeting gun show sales or by wider
        policies such as requiring universal background checks prior to all firearm transfers.

    <GunPolicy name="2. Universal Background Checks">
      <p>Federal law requires background checks on all gun sales from licensed firearm dealers to ensure that gun
          buyers do not fall into one of the categories of people prohibited by law from having a gun. But the law
          does not require background checks on sales from unlicensed sellers, including online or private sales
          making it easy for a prohibited person to acquire a gun.
      </p>

      <p>
        Implementing universal background checks would require the implementation of federal law which would require
        background checks for all firearm transactions.

    <GunPolicy name="3. Increase Mandatory Waiting Periods">
      <!-- https://www.aap.org/en/advocacy/state-advocacy/waiting-periods-for-firearms-purchases/ -->
      <p>
        Under current federal law, there is no waiting period (time between when you want the gun and when you get it)
         requirement for the purchase of guns. Introducing waiting period laws give law enforcement additional time to perform an accurate background
         check and create a “cooling off” period to prevent acts of violence or suicide attempts.

    <GunPolicy name="4. Age Restrict High Capacity Firearms">
      <!-- https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/minimum-age.html -->
      <p>
        Under federal law, licensed dealers cannot sell or deliver handguns to individuals under age 21 or
         long guns to those under age 18. This is problematic as firearm homicides and violent crimes disproportionately
         involve individuals under age 21, both as perpetrators and as victims. Additionally there is a strong association
         between firearm availability and suicide. To reduce firearm violence for individuals under 21 law could be introduced
         to prevent sales of long guns or high calibre rifles to persons aged under 21, similar to that of hand guns.
