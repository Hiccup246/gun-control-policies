# Gun control policies
The purpose of this website is to provide a very simple overview of 10 gun control policies to
spur curiosty and serve as an approachable on-ramp to more information.

Hopefully by summarising key information and collating links to gun control advocacy groups and initiatives this website contributes, in some small way, to the reduction of gun violence in America.

The site can be accessed by heading to [guncontrolpolicies.com](guncontrolpolicies.com) or [commonsenseguncontrols.com](commonsenseguncontrols.com)
